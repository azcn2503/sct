# Simple Combat Tracker

**This is a work in progress.** If you want something that works, try the excellent [Advanced Combat Tracker](https://github.com/EQAditu/AdvancedCombatTracker).

For the plugins, see [sct-plugins](https://github.com/azcn2503/sct-plugins).

## Overview

SCT is an Electron based app that establishes a file watch (tail) on your game log file and parses the lines as they are received through various plugins, with the intention of eventually presenting some meaningful tables and charts so you can digest the numeric spoils of battle and git gud.

## Contributing

See CONTRIBUTING.md.

## I just want to run the app

There are no packaged releases yet, sorry!
